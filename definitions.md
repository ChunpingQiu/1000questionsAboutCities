## Urban (boundary/extent)

 > The definition of urban boundaries varies
with different applications and datasets. Population
is a commonly used indicator when separating urban
and rural areas (Li and Gong 2016a). For example, the
urban center (i.e. an approximate boundary) in the
Global Human Settlement (**GHS**) database is defined
jointly with population (i.e. more than 1500 inhabit-
ants per km 2 ) and urban extent data at a 1 km resol-
ution in 2015 (Florczyk et al 2019). Thus, the derived
urban center in GHS is smaller than the boundary
that is commonly used, which includes most artificial
impervious areas and associated elements (e.g. parks,
lakes, and infrastructures) within the boundary (Jun
2004). 

 > Considering the mapping scope being the entire
globe with diverse urban environments and multiple
years, we adopted the widely used definition of urban
boundary, which is mainly based on the spatial dis-
tribution of artificial impervious areas from Land-
sat data (Hu et al 2015, Peng et al 2016). **That is,
small urban patches are removed and inner non-
urban areas (e.g. green spaces and water bodies) were
filled within the boundary of a city** (Liang et al 2018).

## Built-up areas (建成区)
- 建成区面积是指在行政区划分内被征召且已有实际建设的城市建设用地，比如机场、铁路编组站、污水处理厂等[<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor-1)。
